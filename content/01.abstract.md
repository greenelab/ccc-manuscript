## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is a powerful new tool for uncovering meaningful patterns in data.
CCC is an efficient, easy-to-use, and not-only-linear correlation coefficient based on machine learning models.
It reveals linear and nonlinear patterns that traditional linear-only correlation coefficients miss, including nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships while detecting nonlinear patterns that are not captured by linear-only methods.
Moreover, gene pairs highly ranked by CCC are enriched for interactions in integrated networks, suggesting that CCC could detect functional relationships that linear-only methods miss.
CCC is an effective, next-generation not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.
