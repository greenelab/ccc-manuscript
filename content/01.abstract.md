## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Correlation coefficients are widely used to identify relevant patterns in data.
In transcriptomics, genes with correlated expression often share functions or are part of disease-relevant biological processes.
Here we introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear coefficient based on machine learning models.
We show that CCC can capture biologically meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns missed by standard, linear-only correlation coefficients (Pearson and Spearman).
CCC captures general patterns in data by comparing clustering solutions derived from each variable individually while being much faster than state-of-the-art coefficients such as the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC).
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships while detecting nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences that are not captured by linear-only coefficients.
Gene pairs highly ranked by CCC but not detected by linear-only coefficients showed high probabilities of interaction in tissue-specific networks built from protein-protein interaction, transcription factor regulation, and chemical and genetic perturbations.
CCC is a highly-efficient, next-generation not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can readily be applied to genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.
