## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paper introduces the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can identify biologically meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns missed by standard, linear-only correlation coefficients.
CCC captures general patterns in data by comparing clustering solutions while being much faster than state-of-the-art coefficients such as the Maximal Information Coefficient.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships while detecting nonlinear patterns associated, for example, with sex differences that are not captured by linear-only coefficients.
Gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were enriched for interactions in integrated networks built from protein-protein interaction, transcription factor regulation, and chemical and genetic perturbations, suggesting that CCC could detect functional relationships that linear-only methods missed.
