## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Our Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is an efficient and easy-to-use tool for identifying meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns in data.
CCC is much faster than existing methods, such as the Maximal Information Coefficient, and reveals patterns that linear-only correlation coefficients miss.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identified robust linear relationships as well as nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences.
Furthermore, highly ranked gene pairs identified by CCC were enriched for interactions in integrated networks, suggesting that CCC can detect functional relationships that linear-only methods miss.
CCC is a powerful and versatile tool for detecting meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns in data across different data types.
