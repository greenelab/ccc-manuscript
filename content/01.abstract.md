## Abstract {.page_break_before}

We propose the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient and easy-to-use solution for detecting both linear and nonlinear patterns in gene expression data.
CCC is much faster than existing coefficients such as the Maximal Information Coefficient and reveals biologically meaningful relationships that linear-only correlation coefficients cannot capture.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identified nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences that were not detected by linear-only coefficients.
Additionally, gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were enriched for interactions in integrated networks, suggesting that CCC could detect functional relationships that linear-only methods missed.
Our results demonstrate the potential of CCC to identify meaningful linear and nonlinear relationships in genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.
