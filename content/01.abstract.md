## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Correlation coefficients are essential to identify intriguing relationships in data.
In transcriptomics, genes with correlated expression can suggest that they share functions or are part of disease-relevant biological processes.
Here we introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear coefficient based on machine learning models.
CCC efficiently captures general patterns in data by applying clustering algorithms and automatically adjusting the model's complexity.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC does not miss robust linear relationships while detecting more complex yet biologically meaningful patterns.
CCC can detect non-linear patterns associated with sex as a biological variable missed by standard coefficients.
Gene pairs highly ranked by CCC in expression data alone showed high probabilities of interaction in tissue-specific networks built from protein-interaction data, transcription factor regulation, and chemical and genetic perturbations.
CCC is a highly-efficient, next-generation correlation coefficient that can be readily applied to genome-scale data and in various domains.
