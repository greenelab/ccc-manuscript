## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is an efficient, easy-to-use tool that can detect biologically meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns missed by standard, linear-only correlation coefficients.
CCC reveals general patterns in data by comparing clustering solutions while being much faster than state-of-the-art coefficients such as the Maximal Information Coefficient.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships while detecting nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences that are not captured by linear-only coefficients.
Moreover, gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were enriched for interactions in integrated networks built from protein-protein interaction, transcription factor regulation, and chemical and genetic perturbations, suggesting that CCC can detect functional relationships that linear-only methods miss.
CCC is a powerful, next-generation not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.
