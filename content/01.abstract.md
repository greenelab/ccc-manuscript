## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is an efficient and easy-to-use tool that reveals biologically meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns in data that are missed by standard, linear-only correlation coefficients.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships and nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences, which are not captured by linear-only coefficients.
CCC is also much faster than state-of-the-art coefficients such as the Maximal Information Coefficient.
Additionally, gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were enriched for interactions in integrated networks, suggesting that CCC can detect functional relationships that linear-only methods missed.
CCC is a powerful not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.
