## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Correlation coefficients are used across different research areas to answer critical scientific questions.
Genes with correlated expression, for instance, can provide valuable insight to infer their function and detect disease-relevant tissue-specific patterns.
Indeed, since the introduction of recent models of the genetic architecture of complex traits, gene regulatory networks are playing an increasingly important role in genetic studies and the field of precision medicine.
However, "correlation" is widely understood as "linear correlation," and more complex yet potentially meaningful patterns are usually not considered.
This work provides an efficient and easy-to-use implementation of Clustermatch, a not-only-linear correlation coefficient based on machine learning models.
Clustermatch can derive a similarity value between highly-diverse data features, and it has a single parameter.
Using human RNA-seq data, we provide examples showing that Clustermatch significantly improves the detection of strongly linear and biologically meaningful nonlinear gene-gene relationships.
We also show that Clustermatch and the Maximal Information Coefficient strongly agree, although Clustermatch runs at a fraction of time.
We anticipate that Clustermatch will dramatically improve the detection of crucial molecular patterns completely missed by standard coefficients.
