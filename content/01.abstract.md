## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Our new Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is an efficient and easy-to-use tool for detecting linear and nonlinear patterns in data.
CCC reveals biologically meaningful patterns in transcriptomic data, such as gene expression, that are missed by standard, linear-only correlation coefficients.
CCC is much faster than other state-of-the-art coefficients, such as the Maximal Information Coefficient, and can identify nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC is able to detect robust linear relationships and functional relationships not captured by linear-only methods.
CCC is an effective not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to a variety of data types, making it a powerful tool for data analysis.
