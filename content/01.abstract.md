## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paper presents the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient and not-only-linear correlation coefficient based on machine learning models, to identify linear and nonlinear patterns in transcriptomics data.
We aim to determine if CCC can detect meaningful linear and nonlinear relationships in gene expression data, including those missed by linear-only correlation coefficients, and if highly-ranked gene pairs by CCC are enriched for interactions in integrated networks.
When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships and nonlinear patterns associated with sex differences.
Our results suggest that CCC can detect functional relationships not captured by linear-only methods.
CCC is a highly-efficient, next-generation not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.
