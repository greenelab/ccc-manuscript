## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The research problem/question is clear: what is the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient?

The solution proposed is clear: the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient is an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to genome-scale data.

The text grammar is correct: The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient is an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to genome-scale data.

The spelling errors are fixed: The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient is an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can be applied to genome-scale data.
