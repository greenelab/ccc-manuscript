**Different types of relationships in data.**
Each panel contains a set of simulated data points described by two generic variables: $x$ and $y$.
The first row shows Anscombe's quartet with four different datasets (from Anscombe I to IV) and 11 data points each.
The second row contains a set of general patterns with 100 data points each.
Each panel shows the correlation value using Pearson ($p$), Spearman ($s$) and CCC ($c$).
Vertical and horizontal red lines show how CCC clustered data points using $x$ and $y$.

The CCC provides a similarity measure between any pair of variables, regardless of whether they have numerical or categorical values.
The method assumes that if two variables/features have a relationship, then the **groupings** of the data points/objects using each variable should **align**.
For numerical values, CCC uses quantiles to divide the data points into different clusters (e.g., the median separates numerical data into two clusters).
The CCC is then defined as the maximum adjusted Rand index (ARI) [@doi:10.1007/BF01908075] between the clusterings, ranging from 0 to 1.
Further details about the CCC algorithm can be found in [Methods](#sec:ccc_algo).


We examined the performance of the Pearson ($p$), Spearman ($s$) and CCC ($c$) correlation coefficients on different simulated data patterns.
We used the classic Anscombe's quartet [@doi:10.1080/00031305.1973.10478966] as an example.
This quartet comprises four synthetic datasets with different patterns, but the same data statistics (mean, standard deviation and Pearson's correlation). 

Recently, the simulated data was revisited with the "Datasaurus" [@url:http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html; @doi:10.1145/3025453.3025912; @doi:10.1111/dsji.12233], to remind us of the importance of going beyond simple statistics.
Simple statistics can mask undesirable patterns (such as outliers) or desirable ones (such as biologically meaningful nonlinear relationships).


In contrast, CCC is more suitable for detecting nonlinear relationships and is less affected by outliers.


We simulated additional types of relationships (Figure @fig:datasets_rel, second row), including some previously described from gene expression data [@doi:10.1126/science.1205438; @doi:10.3389/fgene.2019.01410; @doi:10.1091/mbc.9.12.3273].
For the random/independent pair of variables, all coefficients correctly agreed with a value close to zero.
The non-coexistence pattern, captured by all coefficients, represented a case where one gene ($x$) might be expressed while the other one ($y$) is inhibited, highlighting a potentially strong biological relationship (such as a microRNA negatively regulating another gene).

For the other two examples (quadratic and two-lines), Pearson and Spearman did not capture the nonlinear pattern between variables $x$ and $y$.
CCC, however, used different degrees of complexity to capture the relationships.
For the quadratic pattern, it separated $x$ into four clusters to reach the maximum ARI.
The two-lines example showed two embedded linear relationships with different slopes, which neither Pearson nor Spearman detected ($p=-0.12$ and $s=0.05$, respectively).
Here, CCC increased the complexity of the model by using eight clusters for $x$ and six for $y$, resulting in $c=0.31$.
