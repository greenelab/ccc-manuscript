### Clustermatch and Maximal Information Coefficient

![
**Distribution of Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and comparison with others.**
Distribution of MIC values on a small sample of 1% of gene pairs in GTExx v8 (whole blood).
**a)** Histogram of coefficient values.
**b)** Corresponding cumulative histogram. The dotted line maps the coefficient value that accumulates 70% of gene pairs.
**c)** 2D histogram plot with hexagonal bins between all coefficients, where a logarithmic scale was used to color each hexagon.
