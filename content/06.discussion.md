## Discussion

- in the introduction, talk about the importance of studying understudied genes, citing these:
    - "Human genes: Time to follow the roads less traveled?"
    https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000034
    - 

- maybe go to that paper again where they talk about the threshold used in pearson to construct gene co-expression networks
    - i think its the paper on noise
    - clustermatch is less sensitive to noise and it can also capture more complex patterns

- Instead of simple data summaries such as the mean or standard deviation, Clustermatch compares data patterns (clusters) to derive a similarity measure.
- focusing on the differences between clutermatch and linear coefficient, we were able to detect more complex patterns


PONER ESTO POR AHI:

Some of these genes, such as *APOC1* (19q13) and *CCL18* (17q12), were previously found to have an incomplete set of chemical, physical and biological features that correlated well with a lower number of publications [@pmid:30226837].
A gene co-expression analysis beyond linear patterns could shed light on the function of these understudied genes.
On the other hand, gene *KLHL21* (1p36) and the novel RNA gene *AC068580.6* (or *ENSG00000235027*, in 11p15) have a high Clustermatch correlation and are entirely missed by the other methods.
*KLHL21* was recently suggested as a potential therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma [@pmid:27769251] and other cancers [@pmid:29574153; @pmid:35084622], and its nonlinear correlation with *AC068580.6* and potentially other genes might unveil other important players in cancer initiation or progression.
