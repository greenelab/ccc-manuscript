### Replication of gene associations using tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT

We systematically analyzed the other gene pairs in Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs a to assess whether associations were replicated in other datasets besides GTEx.
This is challenging and prone to bias because linear-only correlation coefficients are usually used in gene co-expression analyses.
We used 144 tissue-specific gene networks from the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) [@pmcid:PMC4828725; @url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org], where nodes represent genes and each edge a functional relationship weighted with a probability of interaction between two genes (see [Methods](#sec:giant)).
Importantly, the version of GIANT used in this study did not include GTEx samples [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/data], making it an ideal case for replication.
These networks were built from expression and different interaction measurements, including protein-interaction, transcription factor regulation, and chemical/genetic perturbations and microRNA target profiles from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB [@pmid:16199517]).
We reasoned that if our highly-ranked gene pairs using three different coefficients in a single tissue (whole blood in GTEx, Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs) represented real patterns, then they should replicate across the multi-tissue, multi-cell type functional interaction networks in GIANT.
In addition to predict a network with interactions for a pair of genes, the GIANT web application can also automatically detect a relevant tissue or cell type where genes are predicted to be specifically expressed (the approach uses a machine learning method introduced in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113] and described in [Methods](#sec:giant)).
For example, we obtained the networks in blood and in the automatically-predicted cell type for gene pairs *RASSF2* - *CYTIP* (CCC high, Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs a) and *MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* (Pearson high, Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs b).
In addition to the gene pair, the networks include other genes connected according to their probability of interaction (up to 15 additional genes are shown), which allows to estimate whether genes are part of the same tissue-specific biological process.
Two large black nodes in each network's top-left and bottom-right corners represent our gene pairs.
A green edge means a close-to-zero probability of interaction, whereas a red edge represents a strong predicted relationship between the two genes.

**Analysis of GIANT tissue-specific predicted networks for gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
**a-d)** Four gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients (from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b) with their predicted networks in blood (left) and an automatically selected tissue/cell type (right) using the method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113].
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each network.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges's weights) to be shown.
These networks can be analyzed online using the following links:

In this example, genes *RASSF2* and *CYTIP* (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs a), with a high CCC value ($c=0.20$) and low Pearson and Spearman ($p=0.16$ and $s=0.11$), were both strongly connected to the blood network, with interaction scores of at least 0.63 and an average of 0.75 and 0.84, respectively (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights).
The autodetected cell type for this pair was leukocytes, a blood-specific cell lineage, and interaction scores slightly improved over the blood network (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights).
However, genes *MYOZ1* and *TNNI2*, with a very high Pearson value ($p=0.97$), moderate Spearman ($s=0.28$) and very low CCC ($c=0.03$), were predicted to belong to much less cohesive networks (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs b), with average interaction scores of 0.17 and 0.22 with the rest of the genes, respectively.
Additionally, the autodetected cell type, skeletal muscle, is not a blood cell lineage.
These preliminary results suggested that CCC might be capturing blood-specific patterns missed by the other coefficients.


To confirm this trend, we performed a systematic evaluation using the top 100 gene pairs across intersections where CCC completely disagreed with the rest (CCC high and either of the rest low; or CCC low and either of the rest high).
For each gene pair prioritized in GTEx (whole blood), we autodetected a relevant cell type using GIANT to assess whether genes were predicted to be specifically expressed in a blood-relevant cell lineage.
For this, we took the top five more common autodetected cell types for each coefficient and assessed networks connectivity (see [Methods](#sec:giant)).
Notably, the top 5 predicted cell types for gene pairs highly ranked by CCC and not by the rest were all blood-specific (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top left), including cell lineages like natural killer cells, macrophages, and other leukocytes.
The average probability of interaction between genes in these CCC-ranked networks was also significantly higher than the other coefficients (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top right), with all medians larger than 67% and first quartiles above 41% across predicted cell types.
In contrast, most Pearsonâ€™s gene pairs were predicted to be specific to tissues unrelated to blood (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom left), with skeletal muscle being the most common predicted tissue.
The probabilities of interaction in these Pearson-ranked networks were also generally lower than in CCC, except for blood-specific gene pairs (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom right).
These results show that most gene pairs exclusively detected by CCC in whole blood from GTEx were replicated in more sophisticated network models trained without GTEx samples and including interaction measurements.
CCC-ranked gene pairs did not only have high probabilities of belonging to the same biological process, but also were predicted to be specifically expressed in blood cell lineages.
Conversely, most Pearson-ranked gene pairs were not predicted to be blood-specific, and their probabilities of interaction were relatively very low.
This lack of replication in GIANT suggests that top Pearson-ranked gene pairs in GTEx (and not prioritized by CCC) might be mostly driven by outliers, which is also suggested by the plots in Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b.
