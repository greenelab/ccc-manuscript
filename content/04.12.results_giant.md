### Replication of gene associations using tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT

We sought to systematically analyze discrepant scores to assess whether associations were replicated in other datasets besides GTEx.
We used 144 tissue-specific gene networks from the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) [@pmcid:PMC4828725; @url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org], which did not include GTEx samples [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/data].
Nodes in these networks represent genes, with each edge representing a functional relationship weighted with a probability of interaction between two genes (see [Methods](#sec:giant)).
We hypothesized that highly-ranked gene pairs using three different coefficients in a single tissue (whole blood in GTEx, Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs) should often replicate in a corresponding tissue or related cell lineage using GIANT networks, which are built from expression and different interaction measurements, including protein-interaction, transcription factor regulation, chemical/genetic perturbations and microRNA target profiles from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB [@pmid:16199517]).
For example, gene pairs *RASSF2* - *CYTIP* (CCC high, Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs a) and *MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* (Pearson high, Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs b) were both strongly connected to the blood network.
The autodetected cell type for *RASSF2* - *CYTIP* was leukocytes, and interaction scores were similar to the blood network (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights).
However, *MYOZ1* and *TNNI2* were predicted to belong to much less cohesive networks, with average interaction scores of 0.17 and 0.22 with the rest of the genes, respectively.
The autodetected cell type (skeletal muscle) was not related to blood or one of its cell lineages.
These results suggested that CCC might be capturing blood-specific patterns missed by other coefficients.

**Analysis of GIANT tissue-specific predicted networks for gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
**a-b)** Two gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients (from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b) with their predicted networks in blood (left) and an automatically selected tissue/cell type (right) using the method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113].
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each network.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges' weights) to be shown.
These networks can be analyzed online using the following links:
*RASSF2* - *CYTIP* [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/gene/9770+9595],
*MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/gene/58529+7136].

We evaluated the top 100 discrepant gene pairs between CCC and the other two coefficients using GIANT.
We used the top five most commonly autodetected cell types for each coefficient to assess connectivity in the resulting networks (see [Methods](#sec:giant)).
CCC-ranked gene pairs were all blood-specific, with interaction probabilities significantly higher than the other coefficients (medians larger than 67%, first quartiles above 41%).
Most Pearson-ranked gene pairs were predicted to be specific to tissues unrelated to blood, and their interaction probabilities were generally lower than in CCC, except for blood-specific gene pairs.
CCC-ranked gene pairs had high probabilities of belonging to the same biological process and were predicted to be specifically expressed in blood cell lineages.
Pearson-ranked gene pairs were not predicted to be blood-specific and had low interaction probabilities, indicating outlier-driven associations (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b).
