### Replication of gene associations using tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT

We used the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) to assess whether associations replicated in other datasets besides GTEx.
GIANT includes 144 tissue-specific gene networks, with nodes representing genes and edges representing functional relationships weighted with a probability of interaction.
This version of GIANT did not include GTEx samples, making it ideal for replication.
We used three different correlation coefficients to rank gene pairs in whole blood in GTEx (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs).
We then used GIANT to predict a network with interactions for each pair, and to automatically detect a relevant tissue or cell type (using a machine learning method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113]).
We found that genes with a high CCC value in GTEx (e.g.
*RASSF2* - *CYTIP*) strongly connected to the blood network, with interaction scores of at least 0.63 and an average of 0.75 and 0.84 (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights).
The autodetected cell type was leukocytes.
Genes with a very high Pearson value (e.g.
*MYOZ1* - *TNNI2*) were predicted to belong to much less cohesive networks, with average interaction scores of 0.17 and 0.22 (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs b).
The autodetected cell type was skeletal muscle, not related to blood.
These results suggest that CCC might be capturing blood-specific patterns missed by the other coefficients.

**Analysis of GIANT tissue-specific predicted networks for gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
**a-b)** Two gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients (from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b) with their predicted networks in blood (left) and an automatically selected tissue/cell type (right) using the method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113].
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each network.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges' weights) to be shown.
These networks can be analyzed online using the following links:
*RASSF2* - *CYTIP* [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/gene/9770+9595],
*MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/gene/58529+7136].

The first row combines all gene pairs where CCC is high and Pearson or Spearman are low.
The second row combines all gene pairs where Pearson is high and CCC or Spearman are low.
Bar plots (left) show the number of gene pairs for each predicted tissue/cell type.
Box plots (right) show the average probability of interaction between genes in these predicted tissue-specific networks.
Red indicates CCC-only tissues/cell types, blue are Pearson-only, and purple are shared.

We evaluated the top 100 discrepant gene pairs between CCC and the other two coefficients using GIANT.
We autodetected the relevant cell type for each gene pair prioritized in GTEx (whole blood).
The top 5 cell types predicted for gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were all blood-specific (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top left).
The average probability of interaction between genes in these CCC-ranked networks was significantly higher than the other coefficients (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top right), with all medians larger than 67% and first quartiles above 41%.
In contrast, most Pearson's gene pairs were predicted to be specific to tissues unrelated to blood (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom left), with skeletal muscle being the most commonly predicted tissue.
The interaction probabilities in these Pearson-ranked networks were also generally lower than in CCC (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom right), except for blood-specific gene pairs.
CCC-ranked gene pairs had high probabilities of belonging to the same biological process and were predicted to be specifically expressed in blood cell lineages.
Pearson-ranked gene pairs were not predicted to be blood-specific and had relatively low interaction probabilities.
This suggests Pearson-ranked gene pairs in GTEx might be driven mainly by outliers.
