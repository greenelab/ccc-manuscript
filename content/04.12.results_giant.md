### Replication of gene associations using tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT

We sought to assess whether associations found in GTEx datasets would replicate in other datasets.
To do this, we used 144 tissue-specific gene networks from the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT).
The version of GIANT used in this study did not include GTEx samples, making it an ideal case for replication.
These networks were built from different interaction measurements, including protein-interaction, transcription factor regulation, chemical/genetic perturbations and microRNA target profiles from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).
We hypothesized that highly-ranked gene pairs using three different coefficients in a single tissue (whole blood in GTEx) that represented real patterns would often replicate in a corresponding tissue or related cell lineage using the multi-cell type functional interaction networks in GIANT.
To test this, we used two gene pairs in the GTEx whole blood dataset (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs), *RASSF2* - *CYTIP* (CCC high) and *MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* (Pearson high).
We found that both pairs had strong connections to the blood network, with interaction scores of at least 0.63 and an average of 0.75 and 0.84, respectively (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights).
The autodetected cell type for the first pair was leukocytes, and interaction scores were similar to the blood network.
However, the second pair had much less cohesive networks, with average interaction scores of 0.17 and 0.22 with the rest of the genes, respectively.
The autodetected cell type (skeletal muscle) was not related to blood or one of its cell lineages.
These preliminary results suggest that CCC might be capturing blood-specific patterns missed by the other coefficients.

**Analysis of GIANT tissue-specific predicted networks for gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
**a-b)** Two gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients (from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b) with their predicted networks in blood (left) and an automatically selected tissue/cell type (right) using the method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113].
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each network.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges' weights) to be shown.
These networks can be analyzed online using the following links:

**c)** Summary of predicted tissue/cell type networks for gene pairs exclusively prioritized by CCC and Pearson.
The first row combines all gene pairs where CCC is high and Pearson or Spearman are low.
The second row combines all gene pairs where Pearson is high and CCC or Spearman are low.
Bar plots (left) show the number of gene pairs for each predicted tissue/cell type.
Box plots (right) show the average probability of interaction between genes in these predicted tissue-specific networks.
Red indicates CCC-only tissues/cell types, blue are Pearson-only, and purple are shared.

We evaluated the top 100 discrepant gene pairs between CCC and the other two coefficients using GIANT to autodetect relevant cell types.
The top 5 predicted cell types for gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were all blood-specific (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top left), including macrophage, leukocyte, natural killer cell, blood and mononuclear phagocyte.
The average probability of interaction between genes in these CCC-ranked networks was significantly higher than the other coefficients (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top right).
In contrast, most Pearson's gene pairs were predicted to be specific to tissues unrelated to blood (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom left).
The interaction probabilities in these Pearson-ranked networks were also generally lower than in CCC, except for blood-specific gene pairs (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom right).
This suggests that CCC-ranked gene pairs not only had high probabilities of belonging to the same biological process, but were also specifically expressed in blood cell lineages.
Conversely, most Pearson-ranked gene pairs were not predicted to be blood-specific, and their interaction probabilities were relatively low.
This lack of replication in GIANT supports our earlier observations of outlier-driven associations (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b).
