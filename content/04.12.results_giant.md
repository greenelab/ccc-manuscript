### Replication of gene associations using tissue-specific gene networks from GIANT

We sought to assess whether non-linear relationships between genes were replicated in other datasets besides GTEx.
To do this, we used 144 tissue-specific gene networks from the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) [@pmcid:PMC4828725; @url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org].
The networks were built from expression and different interaction measurements, such as protein-interaction, transcription factor regulation, chemical/genetic perturbations and microRNA target profiles from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB [@pmid:16199517]).
We compared the correlation coefficients of gene pairs using three different coefficients in a single tissue (whole blood in GTEx, Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs).
We then used the GIANT web application to predict a network with interactions for the gene pairs and to automatically detect the relevant tissue or cell type where the genes are expressed (the approach uses a machine learning method introduced in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113] and described in [Methods](#sec:giant)).

We found that gene pairs with a high CCC value ($c=0.20$) and low Pearson and Spearman ($p=0.16$ and $s=0.11$) were both strongly connected to the blood network, with interaction scores of at least 0.63 and an average of 0.75 and 0.84, respectively (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights).
The autodetected cell type for this pair was leukocytes, and the interaction scores were similar to the blood network.
However, genes with a very high Pearson value ($p=0.97$), moderate Spearman ($s=0.28$) and very low CCC ($c=0.03$) were predicted to belong to much less cohesive networks, with average interaction scores of 0.17 and 0.22 with the rest of the genes, respectively.
The autodetected cell type (skeletal muscle) was not related to blood or one of its cell lineages.
These results suggested that CCC might be capturing blood-specific patterns missed by the other coefficients.

**Analysis of GIANT tissue-specific predicted networks for gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
**a-b)** Two gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients (from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b) with their predicted networks in blood (left) and an automatically selected tissue/cell type (right) using the method described in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113].
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each network.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges' weights) to be shown.
These networks can be analyzed online using the following links:

The second row combines all gene pairs where Pearson is high and CCC or Spearman are low.
Bar plots (left) show the number of gene pairs for each predicted tissue/cell type.
Box plots (right) show the average probability of interaction between genes in these predicted tissue-specific networks.
Red indicates CCC-only tissues/cell types, blue are Pearson-only, and purple are shared.

We evaluated the top 100 discrepant gene pairs between CCC and the other two coefficients using GIANT.
This method autodetected relevant cell types for each gene pair and assessed connectivity in the resulting networks.
The top 5 cell types predicted for CCC-ranked gene pairs were all blood-specific (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top left).
The average probability of interaction between these genes was significantly higher than the other coefficients (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top right).
Most Pearson-ranked gene pairs were predicted to be specific to tissues unrelated to blood (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom left), with lower interaction probabilities than CCC-ranked gene pairs.
CCC-ranked gene pairs had higher probabilities of belonging to the same biological process and were predicted to be blood-specific.
This suggests that top Pearson-ranked gene pairs in GTEx might be driven mainly by outliers (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b).
