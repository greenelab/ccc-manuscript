### Clustermatch detects linear and nonlinear patterns in human transcriptomic data

- we used GTEx v8 and the top five tissues with more sample size: muscle (skeletal), whole blood, skin (sun exposed), adipose (subcutaneous) and artery (tibial)
- for each tissue, we selected the top 5,000 genes with largest variance
- and then computed the pairwise correlation using Pearson, Spearman and Clustermatch

- histogram of each coefficient
- 2d histogram comparing each coefficient
- we asked each coefficient to say how similar their gene pairwise values were with the other:
    - no need to show a table, just mention it in the text
