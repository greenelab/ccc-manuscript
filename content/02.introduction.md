## Introduction

New technologies have vastly improved data collection, generating a deluge of information across different disciplines.
This large amount of data provides new opportunities to address unanswered scientific questions, provided we have efficient tools capable of identifying multiple types of underlying patterns.
Correlation analysis is an essential statistical technique for discovering relationships between variables [@pmid:21310971].
Correlation coefficients are often used in exploratory data mining techniques, such as clustering or community detection algorithms, to compute a similarity value between a pair of objects of interest such as genes [@pmid:27479844] or disease-relevant lifestyle factors [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1217269109].
Correlation methods are also used in supervised tasks, for example, for feature selection to improve prediction accuracy [@pmid:27006077; @pmid:33729976].
The Pearson correlation coefficient is ubiquitously deployed across application domains and diverse scientific areas.
Thus, even minor and significant improvements in these techniques could have enormous consequences in industry and research.


In transcriptomics, many analyses start with estimating the correlation between genes.
More sophisticated approaches built on correlation analysis can suggest gene function [@pmid:21241896], aid in discovering common and cell lineage-specific regulatory networks [@pmid:25915600], and capture important interactions in a living organism that can uncover molecular mechanisms in other species [@pmid:21606319; @pmid:16968540].
The analysis of large RNA-seq datasets [@pmid:32913098; @pmid:34844637] can also reveal complex transcriptional mechanisms underlying human diseases [@pmid:27479844; @pmid:31121115; @pmid:30668570; @pmid:32424349; @pmid:34475573].
Since the introduction of the omnigenic model of complex traits [@pmid:28622505; @pmid:31051098], gene-gene relationships are playing an increasingly important role in genetic studies of human diseases [@pmid:34845454; @doi:10.1101/2021.07.05.450786; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265342; @doi:10.1038/s41588-021-00913-z], even in specific fields such as polygenic risk scores [@doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.07.003].
In this context, recent approaches combine disease-associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene co-expression networks to prioritize "core" genes directly affecting diseases [@doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9; @doi:10.1101/2021.07.05.450786; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265342].
These core genes are not captured by standard statistical methods but are believed to be part of highly-interconnected, disease-relevant regulatory networks.
Therefore, advanced correlation coefficients could immediately find wide applications across many areas of biology, including the prioritization of candidate drug targets in the precision medicine field.


The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are widely used because they reveal intuitive relationships and can be computed quickly.
However, they are designed to capture linear or monotonic patterns (referred to as linear-only) and may miss complex yet critical relationships.
Novel coefficients have been proposed as metrics that capture nonlinear patterns such as the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) [@pmid:22174245] and the Distance Correlation (DC) [@doi:10.1214/009053607000000505].
MIC, in particular, is one of the most commonly used statistics to capture more complex relationships, with successful applications across several domains [@pmid:33972855; @pmid:33001806; @pmid:27006077].
However, the computational complexity makes them impractical for even moderately sized datasets [@pmid:33972855; @pmid:27333001].
Recent implementations of MIC, for example, take several seconds to compute on a single variable pair across a few thousand objects or conditions [@pmid:33972855].
We previously developed a clustering method for highly diverse datasets that significantly outperformed approaches based on Pearson, Spearman, DC and MIC in detecting clusters of simulated linear and nonlinear relationships with varying noise levels [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty899].
Here we introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient not-only-linear coefficient that works across quantitative and qualitative variables.
CCC has a single parameter that limits the maximum complexity of relationships found (from linear to more general patterns) and computation time.
CCC provides a high level of flexibility to detect specific types of patterns that are more important for the user, while providing safe defaults to capture general relationships.
We also provide an efficient CCC implementation that is highly parallelizable, allowing to speed up computation across variable pairs with millions of objects or conditions.
To assess its performance, we applied our method to gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression v8 (GTEx) project across different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
CCC captured both strong linear relationships and novel nonlinear patterns, which were entirely missed by standard coefficients.
For example, some of these nonlinear patterns were associated with sex differences in gene expression, suggesting that CCC can capture strong relationships present only in a subset of samples.
We also found that the CCC behaves similarly to MIC in several cases, although it is much faster to compute.
Gene pairs detected in expression data by CCC had higher interaction probabilities in tissue-specific gene networks from the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) [@doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
Furthermore, its ability to efficiently handle diverse data types (including numerical and categorical features) reduces preprocessing steps and makes it appealing to analyze large and heterogeneous repositories.
