## Introduction

The analysis of large RNA-seq datasets can reveal complex transcriptional mechanisms underlying different traits [MULTIPLIER; GTEx; recount2].
In particular, gene-gene relationships can capture important interactions in a living organism that can iluminate their function in other species [@pmid:21606319; @pmid:16968540], recover tissue and cell-type specific patterns [GIANT CASEY], enable transfer of knowledge rare disease [MULTIPLIER] and more recently, complex human traits [PHENOPLIER]

have been very recently used in the context of genetic studies of human diseases.
After the introduction of the omnigenic model of complex traits [THE TWO REFS], gene regulatory networks are thought to play an essential role
A recent study, for example, incorporates genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene co-expression patterns to more accurately prioritize these core genes that are thought to have a more direct effect on diseases [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.21.21265342v2].

Gene co-expression networks (GCN), for instance, can capture interactions between genes in a particular living organism and have been used for MULTIPLE THINGS.

Several computational approaches have been proposed to build gene co-expression networks [WGCNA]
The input to build these graph-based structures are pairwise correlation matrices, where Pearson and Spearman are by far the most common coefficients, mainly because of their fast computation and straightforward interpretation.
However, these coefficients can only capture linear or monotonic relationships between a gene pair, and are suceptible
MIC, DC, 

- there exist methods that can reduce noise or apply different normalization techniques, but this is manual work and time consuming
- another important aspect is that

- the gene co-expression networks can capture these gene
- methods such as random matrix theory (RTM) can detect a threshold under
- noise is a problem; and techniques to deal with it are complex and require several manual steps and be careful ["Addressing noise... paper below"]


AFTER TALKIN ABOUT GCN AND CORRELATION, say that "here we focused on this input, correlation matrices"


- take a look at the other papers related to GIANT (Casey), which are cited in HumanBase, and might have words interesting to put here
