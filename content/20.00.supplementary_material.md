### Comparison with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) on gene expression data {#sec:mic}

We compared all the coefficients in this study with the MIC [@pmid:22174245], a popular non-linear method that can find complex relationships in data, although very computationally intensive [@doi:10.1098/rsos.201424].
To circumvent this limitation of MIC, we took a small random sample of 100,000 gene pairs from all possible pairwise comparisons of our 5,000 highly variable genes from whole blood in GTEx v8.
Then we performed the analysis on the distribution of coefficients (the same as in the main text), shown in Figure @fig:dist_coefs_mic.
We verified that CCC and MIC behave very similarly in this dataset, with essentially the same distribution but only shifted.
Figure @fig:dist_coefs_mic c shows that these two coefficients relate almost linearly and both compare very similarly with Pearson and Spearman.

### Computational complexity of coefficients {#sec:time_test}

We also compared CCC with the other coefficients in terms of computational complexity.
Although CCC and MIC identify the same gene pairs in the gene expression data (see [here](#sec:mic)), the use MIC in large datasets remains limited due to its very long computation time, despite some methodological/implementation improvements [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts707; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0157567; @doi:10.4137/EBO.S13121; @doi:10.1038/srep06662; @doi:10.1098/rsos.201424].
The original MIC implementation uses ApproxMaxMI, a computationally demanding heuristic estimator [@doi:10.1126/science.1205438].
Recently, a more efficient implementation called MIC<sub>e</sub> was proposed [@Reshef2016].
These two MIC estimators are provided by the `minepy` package [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts707], a C implementation available for Python, which we used here.
We compared all these coefficients in terms of computation time on randomly generated variables of differente sizes, which simulates an scenario of gene expression data with different numbers of conditions.
Differently than the rest, our method CCC allows to easily parallelize the computation of a single gene pair (see [Methods](#sec:ccc_algo)), so we also tested the cases using 1 and 3 CPU cores.
The results in Figure @fig:time_test show the time in seconds (left) and its log scale (right).

**Computational complexity of all correlation coefficients on simulated data.**
We simulated variables/features with varying data sizes (from 100 to a million, $x$-axis).
The plots show the average time taken for each coefficient (in seconds on the left, and log scale on the right) on 10 repetitions (1000 repetitions were performed for data size 100).
CCC was run using 1 and 3 CPU cores.
MIC and MIC<sub>e</sub> did not finish running in a reasonable amount of time for data sizes of 10,000 and 100,000, respectively.

As we already expected, Pearson and Spearman were the fastest, given that they only need to compute basic summary statistics from the data.
For example, Pearson is three orders of magnitude faster than CCC.
Among the non-linear coefficients, CCC was faster than the two MIC variations (up to two orders of magnitude), with the only exception in very small data sizes.
The difference is important because both MIC variants were implemented in C [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts707], a high performance programming language, whereas CCC was implemented in Python (optimized with `numba`).
For a data size of a million, the multi-core CCC was twice as fast at the single-core CCC.
This suggests that new implementations using more advaned processing units (such as GPUs) are feasible and could make CCC reach speeds closer to Pearson.

**Predicted tissue-specific networks from GIANT for six gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
Gene pairs are from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b.
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
The cell type for each gene network was automatically predicted using [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113] and it is indicated at the top-right corner of each network.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each subfigure.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges's weights) to be shown.
