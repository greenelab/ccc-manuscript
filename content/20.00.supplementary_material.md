**Predicted interactions between *RASSF2* and *CYTIP* in white blood cells (leukocytes).**
Nodes represent genes and edges are the probability that the gene pair is part of the same biological process in leukocytes.
This analysis can be performed online using HumanBase [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/gene/9770+9595].

**Scatter plots of genes *KDM6A* and *UTY* across different GTEx tissues.**
Clustermatch correctly captures the relationship in all GTEx tissues, and here we show nine of them at the top.
The three figures at the bottom are female-specific organs, where Clustermatch correctly finds no association.
