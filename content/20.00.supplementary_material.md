### Comparison with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) {#sec:mic}

We compared all the coefficients in this study with the MIC [@pmid:22174245], a popular non-linear method that can find complex relationships in data, although very expensive in computational terms.
To circumvent this limitation of MIC, we took a small random sample of 100,000 gene pairs from all possible pairwise comparisons of our 5,000 highly variable genes from whole blood in GTEx v8.
Then we performed the analysis on the distribution of coefficients, shown in Figure @fig:dist_coefs_mic.
We verified that CCC and MIC behave very similarly in this dataset, with essentially the same distribution but only shifted.
Figure @fig:dist_coefs_mic c shows that these two coefficients relate almost linearly and both compare very similarly with Pearson and Spearman.

**Distribution of Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and comparison with other methods.**
Given the high time complexity of MIC, approximately 1% of gene pairs were sampled from our previous set of 5,000 genes (GTEx v8, whole blood).

This result is relevant because MIC represented a significant step forward in correlation analysis research, and it has been successfully used in various application domains [@pmid:33972855; @pmid:33001806; @pmid:27006077].
However, the use of MIC in large datasets remains limited due to its very long computation time [REFERENCE].

Our work and analyses suggest that CCC could be an equally effective but much more efficient next-generation correlation coefficient.

**Predicted tissue-specific networks from GIANT for six gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
Gene pairs are from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b.
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
The cell type for each gene network was automatically predicted using [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113] and it is indicated at the top-right corner of each network.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each subfigure.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges's weights) to be shown.
All these analyses can be performed online using the following links:
