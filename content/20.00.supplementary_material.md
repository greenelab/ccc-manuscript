**Predicted interactions between *RASSF2* and *CYTIP* in white blood cells (leukocytes).**
Nodes represent genes and edges are the probability that the gene pair is part of the same biological process in leukocytes.
This analysis can be performed online using HumanBase [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/gene/9770+9595].
