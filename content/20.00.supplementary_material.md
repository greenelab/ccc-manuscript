### Supplementary Note 1: Comparison with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) on gene expression data {#sec:mic}

We compared the correlation coefficients in this study with MIC [@pmid:22174245], a popular nonlinear method for finding complex relationships in data.
MIC is computationally intensive [@doi:10.1098/rsos.201424], so we ran MIC<sub>e</sub> (see Methods) on all possible pairwise comparisons of our 5,000 highly variable genes from whole blood in GTEx v8.
This took 4 days and 19 hours, compared with 9 hours for CCC.
The analysis of the distribution of coefficients (the same as in the main text) is shown in Figure @fig:dist_coefs_mic.
We found that CCC and MIC had essentially the same distribution, but shifted.
Figure @fig:dist_coefs_mic c shows that these two coefficients have a nearly linear relationship, and both compare similarly to Pearson and Spearman.

### Supplementary Note 2: Computational complexity of coefficients {#sec:time_test .page_break_before}

We compared CCC to other correlation coefficients in terms of computational complexity.
CCC and MIC may identify similar gene pairs in gene expression data (see [here](#sec:mic)), however, MIC is limited when used in large datasets due to its long computation time, despite some methodological/implementation improvements [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts707; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0157567; @doi:10.4137/EBO.S13121; @doi:10.1038/srep06662; @doi:10.1098/rsos.201424].
The original MIC implementation uses ApproxMaxMI, a computationally-intensive heuristic estimator [@doi:10.1126/science.1205438].
Recently, a more efficient implementation called MIC<sub>e</sub> was proposed [@Reshef2016], and is provided by the `minepy` package [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts707], a C implementation available for Python.
We tested these coefficients in terms of computation time on randomly generated variables of different sizes, which mimics a gene expression data scenario with various conditions.
Unlike the rest, CCC allows us to easily parallelize the computation of a single gene pair (see [Methods](#sec:ccc_algo)), so we tested the cases using 1 and 3 CPU cores.
Figure @fig:time_test shows the time in seconds in log scale.

**Computational complexity of all correlation coefficients on simulated data.**
We simulated variables/features with varying data sizes (from 100 to a million, $x$-axis).
The plot shows the average time in seconds (log-scale) taken for each coefficient on ten repetitions (1000 repetitions were performed for data size 100).
CCC was run using 1 and 3 CPU cores.
MIC and MIC<sub>e</sub> did not finish running in a reasonable amount of time for data sizes of 10,000 and 100,000, respectively.
](images/coefs_comp/time_test/time_test-main.svg "Computation time"){#fig:time_test width="55%"}

Pearson and Spearman coefficients, which only require basic summary statistics to be computed, were the fastest among the correlation coefficients tested.
CCC, which is a nonlinear coefficient, was faster than the two MIC variations in most cases, though there were exceptions when data size was very small.
CCC was implemented in Python (with optimizations from the `numba` package), whereas the two MIC variants were implemented in the high-performance language C [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts707].
For a data size of one million, the multi-core CCC was twice as fast as the single-core CCC.
This suggests that more advanced processing units, such as GPUs, could be used to improve the speed of CCC and bring it closer to the speeds of Pearson and Spearman.

**Predicted tissue-specific networks from GIANT for six gene pairs prioritized by correlation coefficients.**
Gene pairs are from Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b.
A node represents a gene and an edge the probability that two genes are part of the same biological process in a specific cell type.
The cell type for each gene network was automatically predicted using [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113], and it is indicated at the top-right corner of each network.
A maximum of 15 genes are shown for each subfigure.
The GIANT web application automatically determined a minimum interaction confidence (edges' weights) to be shown.
