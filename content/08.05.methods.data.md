### Gene expression data and preprocessing {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded the GTEx v8 data for all tissues and normalized it using transcripts per million (TPM).
We focused our primary analysis on whole blood, which had a good sample size of 755.
We selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood with the largest variance after standardizing them with $log(x + 1)$ to avoid bias towards highly-expressed genes.
We then computed Pearson, Spearman, Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) and Conditional Correlation Coefficient (CCC) on these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data, generating a pairwise similarity matrix of 5,000 x 5,000.
