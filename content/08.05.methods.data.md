### Gene expression data and preprocessing {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues, normalized them using transcripts per million (TPM), and focused our primary analysis on whole blood.
This tissue had a good sample size of 755.
We then selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood with the highest variance after standardizing with $log(x + 1)$ to reduce bias towards highly-expressed genes.
To calculate Pearson, Spearman, MIC, and CCC correlations, we generated a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000 from the TPM-normalized data.
