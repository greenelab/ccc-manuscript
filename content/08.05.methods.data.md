### Gene expression data and preprocessing {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues and normalized it using TPM (transcripts per million).
We focused our primary analysis on whole blood, which had a good sample size of 755.
To avoid a bias towards highly-expressed genes, we selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood with the largest variance after standardizing them with the logarithmic transformation $log(x + 1)$.
We then computed Pearson, Spearman, MIC and CCC on these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data, generating a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000.
