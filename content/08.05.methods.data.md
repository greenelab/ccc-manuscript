### Gene expression data and preprocessing {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues, normalized using transcripts per million (TPM), and focused our primary analysis on whole blood, which had a good sample size (755).
We selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood with the largest variance after standardizing with $log(x + 1)$ to avoid a bias towards highly-expressed genes.
We then computed Pearson, Spearman, Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and our proposed Correlation Coefficient for Nonlinear Relationships (CCC) on these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data, generating a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000.
