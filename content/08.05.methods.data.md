We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues, normalized using TPM (transcripts per million), and focused our primary analysis on whole blood, which has a good sample size (755).
We selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood with the largest variance after standardizing with $log(x + 1)$ to avoid a bias towards highly-expressed genes.
We then computed Pearson, Spearman, MIC and CCC on these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data, generating a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000.
