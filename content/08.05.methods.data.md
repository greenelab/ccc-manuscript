### Gene expression data and preprocessing {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues, normalized using transcripts per million (TPM), and focused our primary analysis on whole blood, which had a good sample size (755).
We selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood, standardizing the data with $log(x + 1)$ to avoid a bias towards highly-expressed genes.
We then computed Pearson, Spearman, Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and Correlation Coefficient based on Machine Learning (CCC) on these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data, producing a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000.
