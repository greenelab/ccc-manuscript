### Gene expression data and preprocessing {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues and used transcripts per million (TPM) normalization.
We focused our primary analysis on whole blood, which had a sample size of 755.
We standardized the data with $log(x + 1)$ to avoid a bias towards highly-expressed genes, and then selected the top 5,000 genes with the largest variance.
We computed Pearson, Spearman, MIC and CCC on these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data.
This generated a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000.
