## Code and data availability

The code needed to reproduce all of our analyses and generate the figures is available in [https://github.com/greenelab/ccc](https://github.com/greenelab/ccc).
We provide scripts to download the required data and run all the steps, as well as a Docker image to ensure reproducibility.
We also provide a Python implementation of CCC (optimized with `numba` [@doi:10.1145/2833157.2833162]) published in the Python Package Index (PyPI) that can be easily installed.

GTEx v8 expression data is public and can be downloaded from [https://gtexportal.org/](https://gtexportal.org/).
