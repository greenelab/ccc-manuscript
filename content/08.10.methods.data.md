### Gene expression data, preprocessing and sampling {#sec:data_gtex}

We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues, normalized using TPM (transcripts per million), and focused our primary analysis on whole blood, which has a good sample size (755).
We selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood with the largest variance after standardizing with $log(x + 1)$ to avoid a bias towards highly-expressed genes.
We then computed Pearson, Spearman and CCC on these 5,000 genes across all 755 samples on the TPM-normalized data, generating a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000.
To reduce the time to compute MIC and compare it with the other coefficients, we randomly sampled 100,000 gene pairs from all possible combinations in this set of 5,000 genes ($n * (n-1) / 2=12497500$).
