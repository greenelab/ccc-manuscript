### GTEx v8 data and sampling approach

We downloaded GTEx v8 data for all tissues and focus our primary analysis on whole blood, which has good sample size (755) and has been normalized using TPM (transcripts per million).
We selected the top 5,000 genes from whole blood with the largest variance after standardizing with pseudocounts $log(x + 1)$.
We then computed Pearson, Spearman and Clustermatch on this 5,000 genes across all 755 samples, generating a pairwise similarity matrix of size 5,000 x 5,000.
To reduce the time to compute MIC and compare it with the other coefficients, we randomly sampled 100,000 gene pairs from all possible combinations in this set of 5,000 genes ($n * (n-1) / 2=12497500$).
