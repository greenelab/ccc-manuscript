## Methods

The code needed to reproduce all of our analyses and generate the figures is available in [https://github.com/greenelab/clustermatch-gene-expr](https://github.com/greenelab/clustermatch-gene-expr).
We provide scripts to automatically download the required data and run all the steps.
A Docker image is provided to use the same runtime environment.



### The CCC algorithm {#sec:ccc_algo}

The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) computes a similarity value $c \in \left[0,1\right]$ between any pair of numerical or categorical features/variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ measured on $n$ objects.
CCC assumes that if two features $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are similar, then the partitioning of the $n$ objects using each feature separately should match.
For example, given $\mathbf{x}=(1.1, 2.7, 3.2, 4.0)$ and $\mathbf{y}=10x=(11, 27, 32, 40)$ for $n=4$, partitioning each variable into two clusters ($k=2$) using their medians (2.95 for $\mathbf{x}$ and 29.5 for $\mathbf{y}$) would result in partition $\pi^{\mathbf{x}}=(1, 1, 2, 2)$ for $\mathbf{x}$, and partition $\pi^{\mathbf{y}}=(1, 1, 2, 2)$ for $\mathbf{y}$.
If we compute the agreement between $\pi^{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\pi^{\mathbf{y}}$ using any measure of similarity between partitions, like the adjusted Rand index (ARI) [@doi:10.1007/BF01908075], it will return the maximum value (1.0 in the case of ARI).
For CCC, a given value of $k$ might not be the right one to find a relationship between two features.
For instance, in the quadratic example in Figure @fig:datasets_rel, CCC returns a value of 0.36 (grouping objects in four clusters using one feature and two using the other).
If we used only two clusters instead, CCC would return a similarity value of 0.02.
The CCC algorithm (shown below) searches for this optimal number of clusters given a maximum $k$, which is its single parameter $k_{\mathrm{max}}$.

The main function of the algorithm, `ccc`, generates a list of partitionings $\Omega^{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\Omega^{\mathbf{y}}$ (lines 14 and 15), for each feature $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$.
Then, it computes the ARI between each partition in $\Omega^{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\Omega^{\mathbf{y}}$ (line 16), and then it keeps the pair that generates the maximum ARI.
Finally, since ARI does not have a lower bound (it could return negative values, which in our case are not meaningful), CCC always returns a value between 0 and 1 (line 17).


Since CCC only needs a pair of partitions to compute a similarity value, any type of feature that can be used to perform clustering/grouping of the $n$ objects is supported.
If the feature is numerical (lines 2 to 5 in the `get_partitions` function), then quantiles are used for clustering (for example, the median generates $k=2$ clusters of objects), from $k=2$ to $k=k_{\mathrm{max}}$.
If the feature is categorical (lines 7 to 9), the categories are used to group objects together.
Consequently, since features are internally categorized into clusters, numerical and categorical variables can be naturally integrated since clusters do not need an order.
Although not developed in this study, CCC provides a framework where not only 1-dimensional variables can be compared (such as genes across $n$ samples) but, in theory, also random vectors (multivariate random variables) such as an image.


For all our analyses we used $k_{\mathrm{max}}=10$.
This means that for each gene pair, 20 partitions are generated (10 for each gene), and 100 ARI comparisons are performed.
Smaller values of $k_{\mathrm{max}}$ can reduce computation time, although at the expense of missing more complex, general relationships.
Our examples in Figure @fig:datasets_rel suggest that using $k_{\mathrm{max}}=2$ would force CCC to find linear-only patterns, which could be a valid use case scenario where only this kind of relationships are desired.
In addition, $k_{\mathrm{max}}=2$ implies that only two partitions are generated, and only one ARI comparison is performed.


For a single pair of features (genes in our study), generating partitions or computing their similarity can be parallelized with CCC.
We used three CPU cores in our analyses to speed up the computation of CCC.
A future improved implementation of CCC could potentially use graphical processing units (GPU) to parallelize its computation further.


A Python implementation of CCC (optimized with `numba` [@doi:10.1145/2833157.2833162]) can be found in our Github repository [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/clustermatch-gene-expr], as well as a package published in the Python Package Index (PyPI) that can be easily installed.
