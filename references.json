When run on fruit fly data set including 1,000,000 pairs of gene expression profiles, the mean squared difference between SG and the exhaustive algorithm is 0.00075499, compared with 0.1834 in the case of ApproxMaxMI.

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.</jats:p>",

We observe that pairwise distance between death age in related persons is on average less than pairwise distance in death age between random pairs of unrelated persons. Our goal is to examine the hypothesis that pairwise differences in lifestyle factors correlate with the observed pairwise differences in death age that run in families.

We build a Smoothing Spline ANOVA (SS-ANOVA) model for predicting death age based on four major lifestyle factors generally known to be related to mortality and four major diseases contributing to mortality, to develop a lifestyle mortality risk vector and a disease mortality risk vector. We then examine to what extent pairwise differences in these scores correlate with pairwise differences in mortality as they occur between family members and between unrelated persons. We find significant distance correlations between death ages, lifestyle factors, and family relationships. Considering only sib pairs compared with unrelated persons, distance correlation between siblings and mortality is, not surprisingly, stronger than that between more distantly related family members and mortality. The methodological approach here adapts to exploring relationships between multiple clusters of variables with observable (real-valued) attributes, and other factors for which only possibly nonmetric pairwise dissimilarities are observed.\n          </jats:p>",

To this end, we used DNA microarrays and samples from yeast cultures synchronized by three independent methods: α factor arrest, elutriation, and arrest of a cdc15 temperature-sensitive mutant. Using periodicity and correlation algorithms, we identified 800 genes that meet an objective minimum criterion for cell cycle regulation. In separate experiments, designed to examine the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins. Furthermore, we analyzed our set of cell cycle–regulated genes for known and new promoter elements and show that several known elements (or variations thereof) contain information predictive of cell cycle regulation.

We provide the libraries minerva (with the R interface) and minepy for Python, MATLAB, Octave and C++. The C solution reduces the large memory requirement of the original Java implementation, has good upscaling properties and offers a native parallelization for the R interface. Low memory requirements are demonstrated on the MINE benchmarks as well as on large ( = 1340) microarray and Illumina GAII RNA-seq transcriptomics datasets.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available for download under GPL3 licence at http://minepy.sourceforge.net for minepy and through the CRAN repository http://cran.r-project.org for the R package minerva.

For instance, in multi-holistic approaches in the fruit biology field, data sources can include a mix of measurements such as morpho-agronomic traits, different kinds of molecules (nucleic acids and metabolites) and consumer preferences. These sources not only have different types of data (quantitative and qualitative), but also large amounts of variables with possibly non-linear relationships among them. An integrative analysis is usually hard to conduct, since it requires several manual standardization steps, with a direct and critical impact on the results obtained. These are important issues in clustering applications, which highlight the need of new methods for uncovering complex relationships in such diverse repositories.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We designed a new method named Clustermatch to easily and efficiently perform data-mining tasks on large and highly heterogeneous datasets. Our approach can derive a similarity measure between any quantitative or qualitative variables by looking on how they influence on the clustering of the biological materials under study. Comparisons with other methods in both simulated and real datasets show that Clustermatch is better suited for finding meaningful relationships in complex datasets.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Files can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesinc/files/clustermatch/ and https://bitbucket.org/sinc-lab/clustermatch/.

In this paper, we proposed the BackMIC algorithm for MIC estimation. The BackMIC algorithm adds a searching back process on the equipartitioned axis to obtain a better grid partition than the original implementation algorithm ApproxMaxMI. And similar to the ChiMIC algorithm, it terminates the grid search process by the\n            <jats:italic>χ</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n            -test instead of the maximum number of bins B(\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            ,\n            <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>\n            ). Results on simulated data show that the BackMIC algorithm maintains the generality of MIC, and gives more reasonable grid partition and MIC values for independent and dependent variable pairs under comparable running times.

MIC calculated by the BackMIC algorithm reveals an improvement in statistical power and equitability. We applied (1-MIC) as the distance measurement in the K-means algorithm to perform a clustering of the cancer/normal samples. The results on four cancer datasets demonstrated that the MIC values calculated by the BackMIC algorithm can obtain better clustering results, indicating the correlations between samples measured by the BackMIC algorithm were more credible than those measured by other algorithms.\n          </jats:p>",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. In this regard, the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms can be hypothesized with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), which have represented a significant step forward in testing the mediating role of gene expression in GWAS associations. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked TWAS associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.</jats:p>",

Conversely, variants that cause rare Mendelian diseases are often coding and have a more direct impact on disease development. We demonstrate that common and rare genetic diseases can be linked by studying the gene regulatory networks impacted by common disease-associated variants. We implemented this in the ‘Downstreamer’ method and applied it to 44 GWAS traits and find that predicted downstream “key genes” are enriched with Mendelian disease genes, e.g. key genes for height are enriched for genes that cause skeletal abnormalities and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. We find that 82% of these key genes are located outside of GWAS loci, suggesting that they result from complex <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic> regulation rather than being impacted by disease-associated variants in <jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>. Finally, we discuss the challenges in reconstructing gene regulatory networks and provide a roadmap to improve identification of these highly connected genes for common traits and diseases.</jats:p>",

However, experimental identification of cell-lineage–specific genes in a genome-scale manner is infeasible for most solid human tissues. We developed the first genome-scale method to identify genes with cell-lineage–specific expression, even in lineages not separable by experimental microdissection. Our machine-learning–based approach leverages high-throughput data from tissue homogenates in a novel iterative statistical framework. We applied this method to chronic kidney disease and identified transcripts specific to podocytes, key cells in the glomerular filter responsible for hereditary and most acquired glomerular kidney disease. In a systematic evaluation of our predictions by immunohistochemistry, our in silico approach was significantly more accurate (65% accuracy in human) than predictions based on direct measurement of in vivo fluorescence-tagged murine podocytes (23%). Our method identified genes implicated as causal in hereditary glomerular disease and involved in molecular pathways of acquired and chronic renal diseases. Furthermore, based on expression analysis of human kidney disease biopsies, we demonstrated that expression of the podocyte genes identified by our approach is significantly related to the degree of renal impairment in patients. Our approach is broadly applicable to define lineage specificity in both cell physiology and human disease contexts. We provide a user-friendly website that enables researchers to apply this method to any cell-lineage or tissue of interest. Identified cell-lineage–specific transcripts are expected to play essential tissue-specific roles in organogenesis and disease and can provide starting points for the development of organ-specific diagnostics and therapies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In May 2014, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stated its intent to “require applicants to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) in the design and analysis of NIH-funded research involving animals and cells.” Since then, proposed research plans that include animals routinely state that both sexes/genders will be used; however, in many instances, researchers and reviewers are at a loss about the issue of sex differences. Moreover, the terms sex and gender are used interchangeably by many researchers, further complicating the issue. In addition, the sex or gender of the researcher might influence study outcomes, especially those concerning behavioral studies, in both animals and humans. The act of observation may change the outcome (the “observer effect”) and any experimental manipulation, no matter how well-controlled, is subject to it. This is nowhere more applicable than in physiology and behavior. The sex of established cultured cell lines is another issue, in addition to aneuploidy; chromosomal numbers can change as cells are passaged. Additionally, culture medium contains steroids, growth hormone, and insulin that might influence expression of various genes. These issues often are not taken into account, determined, or even considered. Issues pertaining to the “sex” of cultured cells are beyond the scope of this Statement. However, we will discuss the factors that influence sex and gender in both basic research (that using animal models) and clinical research (that involving human subjects), as well as in some areas of science where sex differences are routinely studied. Sex differences in baseline physiology and associated mechanisms form the foundation for understanding sex differences in diseases pathology, treatments, and outcomes. The purpose of this Statement is to highlight lessons learned, caveats, and what to consider when evaluating data pertaining to sex differences, using 3 areas of research as examples; it is not intended to serve as a guideline for research design.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.",

    "abstract": "Publications in scientific journals contain a considerable fraction of our scientific knowledge. Analyzing data from publication databases helps us understand how this knowledge is obtained and how it changes over time. In this study, we present a mathematical model for the temporal dynamics of data on the scientific content of publications. Our data set consists of references to thousands of genes in the >15 million publications listed in PubMed. We show that the observed dynamics may result from a simple process: Researchers predominantly publish on genes that already appear in many publications. This might be a rewarding strategy for researchers, because there is a positive correlation between the frequency of a gene in scientific publications and the journal impact of the publications. By comparing the empirical data with model predictions, we are able to detect unusual publication patterns that often correspond to major achievements in the field. We identify interactions between yeast genes from PubMed and show that the frequency differences of genes in publications lead to a biased picture of the resulting interaction network.",

    "abstract": "Though many individual transcription factors are known to regulate hematopoietic differentiation, major aspects of the global architecture of hematopoiesis remain unknown. Here, we profiled gene expression in 38 distinct purified populations of human hematopoietic cells and used probabilistic models of gene expression and analysis of cis-elements in gene promoters to decipher the general organization of their regulatory circuitry. We identified modules of highly coexpressed genes, some of which are restricted to a single lineage but most of which are expressed at variable levels across multiple lineages. We found densely interconnected cis-regulatory circuits and a large number of transcription factors that are differentially expressed across hematopoietic states. These findings suggest a more complex regulatory system for hematopoiesis than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "One major objective for plant biology is the discovery of molecular subsystems underlying complex traits. The use of genetic and genomic resources combined in a systems genetics approach offers a means for approaching this goal. This study describes a maize (Zea mays) gene coexpression network built from publicly available expression arrays. The maize network consisted of 2,071 loci that were divided into 34 distinct modules that contained 1,928 enriched functional annotation terms and 35 cofunctional gene clusters. Of note, 391 maize genes of unknown function were found to be coexpressed within modules along with genes of known function. A global network alignment was made between this maize network and a previously described rice (Oryza sativa) coexpression network. The IsoRankN tool was used, which incorporates both gene homology and network topology for the alignment. A total of 1,173 aligned loci were detected between the two grass networks, which condensed into 154 conserved subgraphs that preserved 4,758 coexpression edges in rice and 6,105 coexpression edges in maize. This study provides an early view into maize coexpression space and provides an initial network-based framework for the translation of functional genomic and genetic information between these two vital agricultural species.",

    "abstract": "Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large data sets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.",

Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex tissues and individual cell lineages is crucial for developing improved diagnostics and therapeutics. We present genome-wide functional interaction networks for 144 human tissues and cell types developed using a data-driven Bayesian methodology that integrates thousands of diverse experiments spanning tissue and disease states. Tissue-specific networks predict lineage-specific responses to perturbation, identify the changing functional roles of genes across tissues and illuminate relationships among diseases. We introduce NetWAS, which combines genes with nominally significant genome-wide association study (GWAS) P values and tissue-specific networks to identify disease-gene associations more accurately than GWAS alone. Our webserver, GIANT, provides an interface to human tissue networks through multi-gene queries, network visualization, analysis tools including NetWAS and downloadable networks. GIANT enables systematic exploration of the landscape of interacting genes that shape specialized cellular functions across more than a hundred human tissues and cell types.",

    "abstract": "The maximal information coefficient (MIC) captures dependences between paired variables, including both functional and non-functional relationships. In this paper, we develop a new method, ChiMIC, to calculate the MIC values. The ChiMIC algorithm uses the chi-square test to terminate grid optimization and then removes the restriction of maximal grid size limitation of original ApproxMaxMI algorithm. Computational experiments show that ChiMIC algorithm can maintain same MIC values for noiseless functional relationships, but gives much smaller MIC values for independent variables. For noise functional relationship, the ChiMIC algorithm can reach the optimal partition much faster. Furthermore, the MCN values based on MIC calculated by ChiMIC can capture the complexity of functional relationships in a better way, and the statistical powers of MIC calculated by ChiMIC are higher than those calculated by ApproxMaxMI. Moreover, the computational costs of ChiMIC are much less than those of ApproxMaxMI. We apply the MIC values tofeature selection and obtain better classification accuracy using features selected by the MIC values from ChiMIC.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Yet, only a small fraction of potentially causal genes-about 65 genes out of an estimated several hundred-are known with strong genetic evidence from sequencing studies. We developed a complementary machine-learning approach based on a human brain-specific gene network to present a genome-wide prediction of autism risk genes, including hundreds of candidates for which there is minimal or no prior genetic evidence. Our approach was validated in a large independent case-control sequencing study. Leveraging these genome-wide predictions and the brain-specific network, we demonstrated that the large set of ASD genes converges on a smaller number of key pathways and developmental stages of the brain. Finally, we identified likely pathogenic genes within frequent autism-associated copy-number variants and proposed genes and pathways that are likely mediators of ASD across multiple copy-number variants.

    "abstract": "A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between genetic variation and disease. Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an \"omnigenic\" model.",

    "abstract": "Kelch-like family member 21 (KLHL21) is involved in cell mitosis and motility. Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological function of KLHL21 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) are elusive. This is the first study to describe a pivotal role for KLHL21 in the progression of CCA. The expression of KLHL21 was elevated in CCA tissues compared with paired normal bile duct tissues. In addition, immunohistochemical and statistical analyses demonstrated that the expression of KLHL21 correlated inversely with tumor histological grade (p < 0.05) and the overall survival of patients (p < 0.01). In CCA cells, we found that the inhibition of KLHL21 significantly reduced proliferation, migration and invasion. Further results indicated that inhibition of KLHL21 triggered G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, leading to the increased expression of P21 and P27 and decreased expression of Cyclin E1, which eventually resulted in proliferation suppression in CCA cells. Furthermore, KLHL21 knockdown alleviated the activation of the Erk signaling pathway via decreasing the expression of phospho-Erk1/2. Our data demonstrated that KLHL21 plays an essential role in the tumorigenesis and progression of CCA, implying that it might serve as a potential therapeutic target for CCA treatment.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical research has been previously reported to primarily focus on a minority of all known genes. Here, we demonstrate that these differences in attention can be explained, to a large extent, exclusively from a small set of identifiable chemical, physical, and biological properties of genes. Together with knowledge about homologous genes from model organisms, these features allow us to accurately predict the number of publications on individual human genes, the year of their first report, the levels of funding awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the development of drugs against disease-associated genes. By explicitly identifying the reasons for gene-specific bias and performing a meta-analysis of existing computational and experimental knowledge bases, we describe gene-specific strategies for the identification of important but hitherto ignored genes that can open novel directions for future investigation.",

    "abstract": "Integration of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies is needed to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying GWAS hits, and our ability to identify therapeutic targets. Gene-level association methods such as PrediXcan can prioritize candidate targets. However, limited eQTL sample sizes and absence of relevant developmental and disease context restrict our ability to detect associations. Here we propose an efficient statistical method (MultiXcan) that leverages the substantial sharing of eQTLs across tissues and contexts to improve our ability to identify potential target genes. MultiXcan integrates evidence across multiple panels using multivariate regression, which naturally takes into account the correlation structure. We apply our method to simulated and real traits from the UK Biobank and show that, in realistic settings, we can detect a larger set of significantly associated genes than using each panel separately. To improve applicability, we developed a summary result-based extension called S-MultiXcan, which we show yields highly concordant results with the individual level version when LD is well matched. Our multivariate model-based approach allowed us to use the individual level results as a gold standard to calibrate and develop a robust implementation of the summary-based extension. Results from our analysis as well as software and necessary resources to apply our method are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Most gene expression datasets generated by individual researchers are too small to fully benefit from unsupervised machine-learning methods. In the case of rare diseases, there may be too few cases available, even when multiple studies are combined. To address this challenge, we utilize transfer learning to extract coordinated expression patterns and use learned patterns to analyze small rare disease datasets. We trained a pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) model on a large public data compendium comprising multiple experiments, tissues, and biological conditions and then transferred the model to small datasets in an approach we call MultiPLIER. Models constructed from the public data compendium included features that aligned well to known biological factors and were more comprehensive than those constructed from individual datasets or conditions. When transferred to rare disease datasets, the models describe biological processes related to disease severity more effectively than models trained only on a given dataset.",

    "abstract": "Disease variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) tend to overlap with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), but it remains unclear whether this overlap is driven by gene expression levels 'mediating' genetic effects on disease. Here, we introduce a new method, mediated expression score regression (MESC), to estimate disease heritability mediated by the cis genetic component of gene expression levels. We applied MESC to GWAS summary statistics for 42 traits (average N = 323,000) and cis-eQTL summary statistics for 48 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. Averaging across traits, only 11 ± 2% of heritability was mediated by assayed gene expression levels. Expression-mediated heritability was enriched in genes with evidence of selective constraint and genes with disease-appropriate annotations. Our results demonstrate that assayed bulk tissue eQTLs, although disease relevant, cannot explain the majority of disease heritability.",

We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits.

    "abstract": "An important challenge in the study of functional corticomuscular coupling (FCMC) is an accurate capture of the coupling relationship between the cerebral cortex and the effector muscle. The coherence method is a linear analysis method, which has certain limitations in further revealing the nonlinear coupling between neural signals. Although mutual information (MI) and transfer entropy (TE) based on information theory can capture both linear and nonlinear correlations, the equitability of these algorithms is ignored and the nonlinear components of the correlation cannot be separated. The maximal information coefficient (MIC) is a suitable method to measure the coupling between neurophysiological signals. This study extends the MIC to the time-frequency domain, named time-frequency maximal information coefficient (TFMIC), to explore the FCMC in a specific frequency band. The effectiveness, equitability, and robustness of the algorithm on the simulation data was verified and compared with coherence, TE- and MI- based methods. Simulation results showed that the TFMIC could accurately detect the coupling for different functional relationships at low noise levels. The dorsiflexion experimental results revealed that the beta-band (14-30 Hz) significant coupling was observed at channels Cz, C4, FC4, and FCz. Additionally, the results showed that the coupling was higher in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz) and beta-band (14-30 Hz) than in the gamma-band (31-45 Hz). This might be related to a transition between sensorimotor states. Specifically, the nonlinear component of FCMC was also observed at channels Cz, C4, FC4, and FCz. This study expanded the research on nonlinear coupling components in FCMC.",

    "abstract": "The \"curse of dimensionality\" and the high computational cost have still limited the application of the evolutionary algorithm in high-dimensional feature selection (FS) problems. This article proposes a new three-phase hybrid FS algorithm based on correlation-guided clustering and particle swarm optimization (PSO) (HFS-C-P) to tackle the above two problems at the same time. To this end, three kinds of FS methods are effectively integrated into the proposed algorithm based on their respective advantages. In the first and second phases, a filter FS method and a feature clustering-based method with low computational cost are designed to reduce the search space used by the third phase. After that, the third phase applies oneself to finding an optimal feature subset by using an evolutionary algorithm with the global searchability. Moreover, a symmetric uncertainty-based feature deletion method, a fast correlation-guided feature clustering strategy, and an improved integer PSO are developed to improve the performance of the three phases, respectively. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated on 18 publicly available real-world datasets in comparison with nine FS algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain a good feature subset with the lowest computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Trait-associated genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes.",

Using these tools, data can be downloaded as study-level summaries or queried for specific exon-exon junctions, genes, samples, or other features. Monorail can be used to process local and/or private data, allowing results to be directly compared to any study in recount3.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify loci and genes contributing to disease, but in many cases the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. Here, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq profiles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed gene programs capturing cell types, disease progression, and cellular processes both within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for disease enrichment by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-specific epigenomic maps and computing enrichment scores across 60 diseases and complex traits (average ",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Current therapies have remarkably improved the prognosis of breast cancer patients but still fail to manage metastatic breast cancer. Here, the present study was set to explore the role of microRNA (miR)-660 from tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in breast cancer, particularly in metastasis.",
